I rated myself as a 7 here because my role required me to be in constant contact with the project stake holders. I was constantly communicating with everybody. The project started when two managers approached the hotel looking for accommodation for their employees. It was a big contract where they were expecting us to provide them with a budget and to upgrade our facilities to meet their quality standards, so their employees had the best experience. I rated myself as a seven because I was good at understanding their needs and establishing a sense of collaboration between them and our company. I build rapport with them easily. I also was able to communicate with my team members effectively, and the workers who we would need to work with to achieve some of the upgrades, for example painters and construction workers. I was also friendly and mindful, which led them to really want to be a part of this project and even excited to complete it. I was not perfect, because it was a new task for me, and sometimes I was uncomfortable addressing some of the budget negotiations and communications with some of the third-party companies we were going to hire. But overall, I feel like I did a good job.
